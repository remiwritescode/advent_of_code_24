# Calibration

I can add or multiply the right terms based on their existing order, and all operations are evaluated left to right, regardless of precedence.

The goal is to figure out if a valid calibration (totalling the provided calibration target) exists for the numbers using only addition and multiplication.

## How do I think I can solve this?

Well, there's the brute force method of attempting all permutations of addition and multiplication to see if a valid term exists.
